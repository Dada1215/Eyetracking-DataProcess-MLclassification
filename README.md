# Eyetracking-DataProcess-MLclassification
Dataprocessing of eye-tracking raw data for Classification models 

**Project Context and Objective**  

Based on eye-tracking data from 192 laboratory experiments, this acadamic project of my Master programme in Polytech Nantes aims to practice the data processing, exploratory analysis and features research to build highe performance classifiers ML models to recognise the type of activities.  

**Data Description**  

The dataset consists of eye-tracking experiments involving 24 participants, each performing 8 activities (Read, Watch, Browse, Search, Play, Interpret, Debug, Write), with three variations of each activity to ensure greater behavioral diversity and minimize the influence of the stimulus on classification.  Each CSV file corresponds to an experiment conducted by a specific participant for a given activity, resulting in a total of 192 CSV files. Each file contains real-time eye-tracking system records of the x and y coordinates of screen points where the gaze is focused. Below is an example:
